It is well known that the quality of aquatic ecosystems has degraded and that in extreme cases this can reduce property values, impact human health, and reduce recreational uses.  Managers of these ecosystems have many tools at their disposal to help mitigate these impacts.  To understand how effective these efforts are requires long-term data, such as the University of Rhode Island's Watershed Watch Volunteer Monitoring program data.  We used this data to examine trends in water quality in Rhode Island lake and reservoirs.  Since 1993, nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) have been relatively stable.  Lake temperature and chlorophyll, a potential indicator of harmful algal blooms, have both increased overtime.  This work highlights the role that physical parameters (i.e., temperature) may play in controlling algal growth in lakes, indicates that efforts to control nutrients in Rhode Island have prevented an unwanted increase, and shows that to reduce chlorophyll and related impacts will require additional management efforts.  Furthermore, this study is one of the first to utilize the rich, long-term data collected by colleagues and volunteers at the URI Watershed Watch program.

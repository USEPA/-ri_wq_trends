Managing the impacts of human activities on aquatic ecosystems has been the focus of lake management efforts for several decades. The research that supports these efforts, suggess that managing phosphorus and nitrogen can mitigate the impacts of eutrophication, such as harmfaul algal blooms.  Long-term datasets are required to determine the effectiveness of these mangement efforts.  The "LAke multi-scaled GeOSpatial and temporal database", or LAGOSNE (<https://lagoslakes.org/products/data-products/>) is one such dataset.  Studies using LAGOSNE found relatively stable water quality at regional spatial scales, however, these studies may mask trends at smaller scales.  We address this and use the University of Rhode Islandâ€™s Watershed Watch Volunteer Monitoring Program (URIWW) dataset to examine long-term water quality trends at a smaller scale.  URIWW has collected water quality data on Rhode Island lakes and reservoirs for over 25 years which allows us to explore long-term trends in common water quality parameters. Additionally, the URIWW data was included in LAGOSNE and provides an opportunity to compare water quality trends at different scales. We use scaled anomalies, also known as a z-score, to assess the data for trends.  The z-scores were caculated an a per-station basis and averaged for each year in the dataset.  The Rhode Island data show increasing temperature and chlorophyll *a*.  Total nitrogen showed a weak increasing trend driven by two unusally low years in the early 1990s.  Total phosphorus and the Nitrogen:Phosphorus ratio (N:P) were both stable.  Applying the site-specific z-score approach to the larger LAGOSNE data, found similar trends to prior studies with chlorophyll *a*, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and N:P all stable over time.  In short, productivity in Rhode Island lakes and reservoirs is increasing, in spite of stable nutrient regimes and although this analysis is not able to discern causation, it suggests that increasing lake temperature may be a driver of increasing productivity.  This analysis also points out the incredible value of data from long-term monitoring programs, like URIWW, for identifying trends in environmental condition, and the utility of site-specific z-scores for analysing data from long-term trends.

abstract: The University of Rhode Islandâ€™s Watershed Watch Volunteer Monitoring Program has been collecting water quality data on dozens of Rhode Island lakes and ponds for over 25 years, allowing us to explore long-term trends in common water quality parameters.  Not all lakes and ponds in the study area were sampled across the full time period and lakes were often added in geographic clusters (e.g. in urbanized northern Rhode Island).  Not unlike how long-term temperature records are analyzed, we centered and scaled (i.e., the z-score) water quality measurements on a per-station basis. This provides a robust and commonly scaled measurement to explore this data for long-term trends.  State-wide aggregation shows increasing temperature, chlorophyll *a*, and total nitrogen. Interestingly, total phosphorus is showing a decline, perhaps reflecting the management focus on phosphorus reductions.  While yearly trends are useful, they do mask month-to-month variability differences across sites.  Additionally, while most sites track the yearly trend in decreasing water quality, there are bright spots with some sites improving over the 25 years. Contrary to previously reported analyses that show relatively stable water quality at the regional scale, our analysis shows that long-term water quality trends within Rhode Island show some parameters improving while others are in decline.  Importantly, this analysis also points out the incredible value and importance of data from long-term monitoring programs, like Watershed Watch, for identifying trends in environmental condition.

# Introduction

General stuff about long-term trends, monitoring programs and watersehd watch details

Given what is known about long term trends in water quality within the broader New England region [@Oliver_2017], we were curious if those trends were also present in water quality trends in Rhode Island lakes and ponds.  Something about spatial and temporal variability of water quality

The goals of this study were to look at 25 years (still 25? need to check) of lakes and ponds data in Rhode Island.  The particular questions we were hoping to answer are: 1.) What are the state-wide trends in total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll *a*, and temperature; 2.) are water quality trends in Rhode Island similar to regional trends in the northeastern United states; 3.) Given trends at the state level, are there individual lakes and ponds that have water quality that deviate from the state-wide trends.  In addition to these goals, this analysis has also been done using open data from the URI Watershed Watch program and the analysis in its entirety is available for independent reproduction at <https://github.com/usepa/green_murky_warm>.

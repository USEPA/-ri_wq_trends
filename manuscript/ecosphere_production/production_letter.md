Title: Analyzing long-term water quality of lakes in Rhode Island and the Northeastern United States with an anomaly approach

Dear Dr. Hollister:

Although your manuscript has been accepted for publication it is now being returned to your Author Center in ScholarOne for you to review and make final adjustments or corrections prior to typesetting, page production, and publication.

Please read this entire message and follow closely the instructions found in the Author Guidelines online at

https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/21508925/resources/author-guidelines-ECS2

in the preparation of the final version of the manuscript in order to avoid delays in the processing and publication of your manuscript. See the entire section following the heading "Accepted Manuscripts." See also the Checklist for Preparation of the Final Manuscript below my signature.

Special instructions (specific to your manuscript, but in addition to the general preparation instructions in the Author Guidelines):

1. Manuscript type: The Editorial Board of Ecosphere has started a new track in Ecosphere called "Freshwater Ecology." We would like to publish your paper under the Freshwater Ecology banner, where it will be highlighted with other papers in the track (see https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)2150-8925.Freshwater-Ecology for the updated list of articles), in addition to appearing on the table of contents of the issue in which it is published. If you are amenable to having your paper appear as a contribution to this track, please place "Freshwater Ecology" on the title page of your manuscript and choose that manuscript type in Step 2 in the ScholarOne submission form.

2. Literature Cited: Please follow the formats found in the Author Guidelines for the citations in the list of literature cited, check that each citation has complete information, and check that all references in text have a matching citation in the list and vice versa. The greatest share of corrections at the page proof approval stage are related to the literature references and citations.

3. Figures: Each figure should be provided in an individual, complete file (identified by figure number in the file name), preferably as a high-resolution (300-600 dpi) TIFF or high-quality PDF. Only one version of each figure should be provided. Please delete figure images from the main manuscript file. Please be sure that all parts, including all lettering, symbols, labels, and scale numbers, are discernible, clear, and readable when the figures are presented at the maximum allowable size (15.6 cm wide by 20 cm tall) in the typeset and paged PDF version of the article.

4. Figure legends: Please be sure to include a list of figure legends in the main manuscript file.

The final version of your manuscript should be uploaded only after all coauthors have carefully read and approved the text and illustrative materials. If you have questions regarding the preparation of the final files for page production and online publication, please contact esajournals@esa.org.

Once you have prepared the final versions of the files, you may access the paper and go directly to Step 1 in the First Look submission process by clicking on the link below:

Checklist for Preparation of the Final Manuscript

Please see the Author Guidelines found at https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/21508925/resources/author-guidelines-ECS2

__x___ 1. Title: The title must be composed of no more than 120 characters, including spaces and punctuation.
__x___ 2. Title page: See instructions regarding format.
__x___ 3. Check that the hierarchy of headings is discernible.
__x___ 4. Check that the in-text reference style matches the format in the Author Guidelines.
__x___ 5. Check that the citations in the literature cited section follow the formats outlined in the Author Guidelines and that complete information is provided. Most corrections at the page proof stage are associated with in-text references and literature citations.
__x___ 6. Check that the tables follow the Author Guidelines. To determine whether a table will fit on the PDF page, it must fit width-wise in Times New Roman, 10-point type, on an 8.5 x 11 inch page in portrait orientation (NOT landscape) with a minimum margin of 0.5 inch.
__x___ 7. Check that figures are prepared according to the instructions in the Author Guidelines. Figures must be of adequate resolution (at least 300 dpi but not more than 600 dpi), should be trimmed of extra white space around the image, and should be no wider than 15.6 cm and no taller than 20 cm. Once you have prepared the figures, we recommend that you print them at 100% and place them alongside a printed page from the PDF version of an article posted in Ecosphere to determine that you are satisfied with the size and quality of the figures. We urge you to check the figures carefully for any misspellings or other potential errors.
__x___ 8. Check that tables and figures are mentioned in the body of the manuscript in numeric order.
__x___ 9. Display equations should be formatted using MathType software (a free trial version is available online). Do not use Word's Equation Editor for any special characters, abbreviations or inline equations.
__x___ 10. Supporting Information: Please see the instructions regarding Supporting Information. Note especially that appendices are identified as, e.g., Appendix S1, Appendix S2, and so on. Tables and figures are identified as, e.g., Table S1, Table S2, Fig. S1, Fig. S2, within each numbered appendix, with the numbering beginning anew (starting with S1) in each appendix. Each appendix should be presented as it is intended to be posted online, each in a separate file. Please be sure to include the title of the journal, the title of the article, and all of the authors' names on the first page of each appendix.
__x___ 11. Do not submit any new supporting information, either appendices, data, or code, that was not submitted during peer review, prior to acceptance for publication. You may archive such material in a permanent repository and provide a "Data Availability" statement after the Acknowledgments section in the main manuscript.
_____ 12. You may upload a high-quality, high-resolution image to be considered for the "cover" of the journal. The photo should be an original shot (not a stock photo) of the study organism or environment, should be closely associated with the topic of the study, should not include any people, and should not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. We strongly prefer images taken by one of the authors of the paper. Name the file clearly (e.g., "cover image") and designate it as "Additional file NOT for review and NOT for publication" in ScholarOne.
__x___ 13. Do not send files by email attachment unless instructed to do so. In order to avoid delaying publication, upload files to Ecosphereâ€™s ScholarOne. An initial quality control check is performed and you will be informed if any further preparation by you is necessary.
